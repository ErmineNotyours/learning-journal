# LJ Code 301 Day 4

The best accomplishment of Tuesday is that I finally completed a Code Wars challenge without any help from my partner or a TA.  My first week's partner was well-versed in Regex, and he solved the problem immediately.  He had no patience for anyone who cold not wrap his head around Regex.  Then he went home sick and the TA helped me with the next challenge.  I made some progress in Regex, but I mostly had to use the code found by the TA.  Before he left, my last week's partner said you could not include calculations within the brackets for holding array indices.  I begged to differ.  It may not be best practices, but I had used them before, and I wondered if Code Wars would accept them.  This week I found out when I solved the challenge on my own.  There were offset calculations within the index brackets, and Code Wars accepted it.  For once, I completed it before my lab partner.  It was not as elegant as the popular solutions already submitted, buy mine seemed to be the only one using slice to add characters to a string.

301 is harder than 201, and I'm noticing the effects of lack of sleep more.  I wasn't getting what my first week lab partner was telling me, and he accused me of being hostile.  This is where the promised reviews of emotional intelligence would be helpful.

In other news, labs 1 and 2 remain incomplete, even though now I have code review to help me solve them.  I need to flag down a TA on Saturday to find out why the external files are not linking.
