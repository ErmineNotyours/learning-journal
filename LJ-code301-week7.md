# Week 7

With this week, I'm falling even further behind.  I never was able to make the UI Challenge 2 functional.  Even though I was supposed to quit after three hours, I was still progressing along by that point so I kept going.  At four hours I had everything down except the JavaScript, which the instructions suggested would be necessary for the project to work.  The CSS would seem to have to do *something* according to the sources I got the code from, yet it didn't do anything.  I wouldn't even know where to begin to use JavaScript to make styling functional, so I gave up.  Then I spent what could have been valuable co-work time to go over the code review for the challenge, and I quickly fell behind that.  Because this was informal class time, the lesson was not captured on YouTube, though it could be on the nest cam.

Not that sticking with my lab partner would have helped much.  Without the ability to migrate database data on Windows, I've fallen completely behind the final labs.  Michael at one time offered to install Ubuntu on my laptop, but I don't know if that would help at this point.  Maybe it could still be useful for the Python 401.  Last week I at least tried to follow along and update the changelogs, but now I'm so far behind I can't even follow along when Chris asks me a question.  The parade is passing me by.  (I'm writing this on Saturday as my lab partner is doing most of the work.)

After lunch I was able to help Chris, bounce ideas off of and offer ideas for debugging that he executes.

I got another dose of reality with the Code War challenges.  Mostly, Highest Scoring Word was just what I needed: a meaty project not easy like the previous katas, but still possible to grasp unlike the labs.  I got as far as separating out the words, scoring them and finding the high score, as well as putting each word into its own element of an array.  The trick was to sync the word with its score so it could be output.  By making the words and the scores members of the same object they could sort together, so I tried that approach.  I soon found that I had no idea how to manipulate objects, and my previous understanding was tenuous at best.  I finally got help from Raphael to implement the rest of the challenge based on what I had done so far, even though I was sure I could have solved this challenge myself.  That is a goal for the month and a half break between 301 and 401 Python: relearn objects by refactoring the challenge using them, even though no other solution uses objects.  I thought I had a handle on objects in the Salmon Cookies lab, so I will have to go back to that code.

In Mutate My Strings, I search through MDN finally finding substring().  However, it had two parameters, and I could never figure out what they did.  The second one (wordOne) worked fine with just the loop iterator in it, but I tried various combinations on wordTwo.  By accident, I typed a 1 instead of the iterator i, and that did the trick, just through dumb luck.  Even though I solved it myself, I didn't feel I thoroughly understood it.

After two weeks of easy or fairly easy quizzes, the current one was hard again.  I took 80 minutes to do the first attempt, and got four answers wrong.  This is ahead of the anxiety of the entrance exam, especially after hearing other students troubles with the task.  I had put off the Meetup assignment until this Sunday, so I won't have much time for the exam except for Monday before class, and luckily I have the day off from work.

The final exam seemed to start out much better than the previous class's exam, though I'm still failing it.
