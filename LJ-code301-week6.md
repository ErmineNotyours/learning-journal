# Week 6

Once again I'm leaning on the expertise of my lab partner, but this week it got particularly worse.  Ever since I started Code Fellows, they've highly recommended that all Windows users install Linux.  I kept putting it off, waiting until I really need to, and then it came during Lab 11 that I really needed to.  I had a thumb drive with me, so maybe I could have done it if I was not doing anything else, but I was busy looking up stuff for Chris, or displaying reference documents, or writing the change log.  I might have had time this weekend, but I was busy with the UI  Besides that, even Chris was stumped getting the page to properly display remotely, making me feel guilty for not being able to help more.  If even JB got stumped during the class demonstration, it must be an advanced topic.

Aside from that, I was told I was 100% caught up on my work, so I didn't have to spend weekends doing resubmits.  I caught up on the midweek readings early, and I think I got a handle on the weekend reading on JSON and API pushState()

Even though the instructions didn't say so specifically, I wanted to do the class 11 Kata "Sum of Odd Cubes" using map, filter and reduce, because I failed to use reduce last time and I only copy and pasted map.  It took two hours, while Chris was prepping the project code without me, but I mostly got the Kata done myself.  The suggestion that I not nest the functions but do them separately helped the three methods stand out and should provide a reference in the future.

Now I'm feeling some anxiety about the final project.  In 201 I volunteered to lead a group (which was taken over by someone else), but now I feel so inadequate that I wonder if I'll be able to contribute to a team at all.
