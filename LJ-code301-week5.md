# Week 5

Though the impostor syndrome was mentioned in the class, I really feel like an impostor because once again my lab partner had to pull me through the lab.  When asked, I said I would have to review SQL, and perhaps try SQL Bolt with a notepad nearby so I could write down my attempted answer before I ask it to give me the answer, in which case it wipes off my attempt and I don't know what I did wrong.  I tried to learn more about SQL in Kahn Academy, but once again I got stuck on an answer even though it is displaying the right info.  I had a TA solve another stuck answer on JSON, and even she couldn't solve it.  Once again, I had to switch to Solo Learn, which at least has a discussion forum, so stuck answers wouldn't be stuck for long.

I used some of the holiday time off to do some extra learning, but I'm not sure I've retained much of it.

On the plus side, I got 100% on a quiz on the first attempt.
