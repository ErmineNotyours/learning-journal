# Learning Journal Code 301 Month 1

Whoops, without learning journals actually being assigned, I fell behind in doing them.

Work continues to be hectic, with little time for it to stick, but at least I had some time over the holidays to revisit the material in Kahn Academy and Solo Learn.  I continue to let my lab partner do most of the work while I try to watch and remember, though I know some day will come when I'm partnered with someone less capable than me.  Then I might actually have to learn something to get the job done.  The days went by quick back in 201 when I felt I had a handle on things and could actually conceive of and create original projects.  Aside from the Code War challenges, I rarely get the satisfaction of actually completing anything.  And I have the nagging feeling that when the classes are over and I start doing this for real, it will be more of the same.

This week while waiting for people to show up to train me for a new task at work, I had time to catch up on the on-line training for my job.  I encountered a problem I had noticed before: the default browser they give us, Explorer, does not render a key web page needed to access the training.  I tried to inspect the page to see if I could find the link manually, and felt overwhelmed by the DOM I saw there.  You would think by now I would get it, because I'm going to have to navigate unfamiliar architecture on my job.  Also it's a pause for thought that if my work had created a simpler site, or had known it would mostly be used on the browser that comes on Windows machines automatically, they would design their sites more sensibly and be much better off.  I had time, so I installed Chrome just to navigate past that page.  Great, except my training uses Flash, which the new install of Chrome didn't allow.  Just the typical bureaucracy at work I'm hoping to leave once I get a better career.
